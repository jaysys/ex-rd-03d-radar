# Radar-Based-Home-Security-System

Traditional home security systems have a fatal flaw. PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors, the backbone of most security setups, are notorious for false alarms triggered by pets, moving curtains, temperature changes, or even sunlight shifting through windows. They also struggle with range limitations and can be easily fooled by slow-moving intruders or those wearing heavy clothing that masks body heat.

Enter radar technology, the same principle used in military applications and autonomous vehicles. Unlike PIR sensors that detect heat signatures, radar actively measures motion, distance, and even speed with millimeter precision.

That’s where my system comes in. By combining the precision of the RD-03D mmWave radar sensor with the advanced connectivity and processing power of the Beetle ESP32-C6, I’ve built a compact, battery-powered security solution that delivers real-time intruder detection, smart alerts, and radar visualization through a web dashboard. Unlike off-the-shelf systems, this DIY setup tracks multiple moving targets, analyzes their behavior, and minimizes false alarms with intelligent filtering. It’s designed to be deployed anywhere, indoors or outdoors, with long battery life, weatherproofing, and full integration with Home Assistant for smart automation.
